A primitive type is passed to a function by value
	e.g.

	A function that receives a string, adds a timestamp to it, and displays it

	var add_timestamp = function ( text ) {
		var now = new Date();
		text = text + " " + now.toString();
		console.log(text);
	}
add_timestamp( 3 );


Code that calls the function and passes a string argument

var message = "Error: Value out of range.";
add_timestamp(message); //displays time stamp

Code that displays the value that was passed to the function

alert(message);  // message hasn't been changed

An object passed is passed to a function by reference
	A function that receives an array and changes its first element
